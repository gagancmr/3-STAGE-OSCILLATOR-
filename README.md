# 3-STAGE-OSCILLATOR-

## Aim: To Design CMOS 3 stage oscillator and OP analysis.

## Tools Used: Virtuoso Schematic Editor is used for the design and analysis.

## Theory:
3-stage oscillator consists of three amplifier stages connected in a feedback loop, each providing a phase shift of 60°, resulting in a total 180° phase shift. Combined with the 180° phase shift from inversion, the loop gain and phase conditions for oscillation are satisfied. Commonly built using RC networks, it generates stable sine waves and is widely used in low-frequency applications.

## Procedure:
•	Click new -> library attach to an existing technology library gpdk045(in
technology file )
•	new cell view (name of the layout)

## For schematic:
•	Pick the components NMOS, PMOS, ground, VDD and voltage source.
•	Connect the wire as per the schematic diagram.
